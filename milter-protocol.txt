OVERVIEW

The date of this document is contained within the "Id" symbolic CVS/RCS
tag present at the top of this document.

This document describes the Sendmail "milter" mail filtering and
MTA-level mail manipulation protocol, version 2, based on the publicly
available C-language source code to Sendmail, version 8.11.6.

As of this writing, this protocol document is based on the
implementation of milter in Sendmail 8.11, but has been verified
compatible with Sendmail 8.12.  Some Sendmail 8.12 extensions,
determined by flags sent with the SMFIC_OPTNEG command, are not yet
described here.

Technical terms describing mail transport are used throughout.  A reader
should have ample understanding of RFCs 821, 822, 2821, and their
successors, and (for Sendmail MTAs) a cursory understanding of Sendmail
configuration procedures.

______
LEGEND

All integers are assumed to be in network (big-endian) byte order.  
Data items are aligned to a byte boundary, and are not forced to any
larger alignment.

This document makes use of a mnemonic representation of data structures
as transmitted over a communications endpoint to and from a milter
program.  A structure may be represented like the following:

'W'	SMFIC_HWORLD	Hello world packet
uint16	len		Length of string
char	str[len]	Text value

This structure contains a single byte with the ASCII representation 'W',
a 16-bit network byte order integer, and a character array with the
length given by the "len" integer.  Character arrays described in this
fashion are an exact number of bytes, and are not assumed to be NUL
terminated.

A special data type representation is used here to indicate strings and
arrays of strings using C-language semantics of NUL termination.

char	str[]		String, NUL terminated
char	array[][]	Array of strings, NUL terminated

Here, "str" is a NUL-terminated string, and subsequent data items are
assumed to be located immediately following the NUL byte.  "array" is a
stream of NUL-terminated strings, located immediately following each
other in the stream, leading up to the end of the data structure
(determined by the data packet's size).

____________________
LINK/PACKET PROTOCOL

The MTA makes a connection to a milter by connecting to an IPC endpoint
(socket), via a stream-based protocol.  TCPv4, TCPv6, and "Unix
filesystem" sockets can be used for connection to a milter.  
(Configuration of Sendmail to make use of these different endpoint
addressing methods is not described here.)

Data is transmitted in both directions using a structured packet
protocol.  Each packets is comprised of:

uint32	len		Size of data to follow
char	cmd		Command/response code
char	data[len-1]	Code-specific data (may be empty)

The connection can be closed at any time by either side.  If closed by
the MTA, the milter program should release all state information for the
previously established connection.  If closed by the milter program
without first sending an accept or reject action message, the MTA will
take the default action for any message in progress (configurable to
ignore the milter program, or reject with a 4xx or 5xx error).

_____________________________
A TYPICAL MILTER CONVERSATION

The MTA drives the milter conversation.  The milter program sends
responses when (and only when) specified by the particular command code
sent by the MTA.  It is an error for a milter either to send a response
packet when not requested, or fail to send a response packet when
requested.  The MTA may have limits on the time allowed for a response
packet to be sent.

The typical lifetime of a milter connection can be viewed as follows:

MTA			Milter

SMFIC_OPTNEG
			SMFIC_OPTNEG
SMFIC_MACRO:'C'
SMFIC_CONNECT
			Accept/reject action
SMFIC_MACRO:'H'
SMFIC_HELO
			Accept/reject action
SMFIC_MACRO:'M'
SMFIC_MAIL
			Accept/reject action
SMFIC_MACRO:'R'
SMFIC_RCPT
			Accept/reject action
SMFIC_HEADER (multiple)
			Accept/reject action (per SMFIC_HEADER)
SMFIC_EOH
			Accept/reject action
SMFIC_BODY (multiple)
			Accept/reject action (per SMFIC_BODY)
SMFIC_BODYEOB
			Modification action (multiple, may be none)
			Accept/reject action

			(Reset state to before SMFIC_MAIL and continue,
			 unless connection is dropped by MTA)

Several of these MTA/milter steps can be skipped if requested by the
SMFIC_OPTNEG response packet; see below.

____________________
PROTOCOL NEGOTIATION

Milters can perform several actions on a SMTP transaction.  The following is
a bitmask of possible actions, which may be set by the milter in the
"actions" field of the SMFIC_OPTNEG response packet.  (Any action which MAY
be performed by the milter MUST be included in this field.)

0x01	SMFIF_ADDHDRS		Add headers (SMFIR_ADDHEADER)
0x02	SMFIF_CHGBODY		Change body chunks (SMFIR_REPLBODY)
0x04	SMFIF_ADDRCPT		Add recipients (SMFIR_ADDRCPT)
0x08	SMFIF_DELRCPT		Remove recipients (SMFIR_DELRCPT)
0x10	SMFIF_CHGHDRS		Change or delete headers (SMFIR_CHGHEADER)
0x20	SMFIF_QUARANTINE	Quarantine message (SMFIR_QUARANTINE)

(XXX: SMFIF_DELRCPT has an impact on how address rewriting affects
addresses sent in the SMFIC_RCPT phase.  This will be described in a
future revision of this document.)

Protocol content can contain only selected parts of the SMTP
transaction.  To mask out unwanted parts (saving on "over-the-wire" data
churn), the following can be set in the "protocol" field of the
SMFIC_OPTNEG response packet.

0x01	SMFIP_NOCONNECT		Skip SMFIC_CONNECT
0x02	SMFIP_NOHELO		Skip SMFIC_HELO
0x04	SMFIP_NOMAIL		Skip SMFIC_MAIL
0x08	SMFIP_NORCPT		Skip SMFIC_RCPT
0x10	SMFIP_NOBODY		Skip SMFIC_BODY
0x20	SMFIP_NOHDRS		Skip SMFIC_HEADER
0x40	SMFIP_NOEOH		Skip SMFIC_EOH

For backwards-compatible milters, the milter should pay attention to the
"actions" and "protocol" fields of the SMFIC_OPTNEG packet, and mask out
any bits that are not part of the offered protocol content.  The MTA may
reject the milter program if any action or protocol bit appears outside
the MTA's offered bitmask.

_____________
COMMAND CODES

The following are commands transmitted from the MTA to the milter
program.  The data structures represented occupy the "cmd" and "data"
fields of the packets described above in LINK/PACKET PROTOCOL.  (In
other words, the data structures below take up exactly "len" bytes,
including the "cmd" byte.)

**

'A'	SMFIC_ABORT	Abort current filter checks
			Expected response:  NONE

(Resets internal state of milter program to before SMFIC_HELO, but keeps
the connection open.)

**

'B'	SMFIC_BODY	Body chunk
			Expected response:  Accept/reject action

char	buf[]		Up to MILTER_CHUNK_SIZE (65535) bytes

The buffer is not NUL-terminated.

The body SHOULD be encoded with CRLF line endings, as if it was being
transmitted over SMTP. In practice existing MTAs and milter clients
will probably accept bare LFs, although at least some will convert CRLF
sequences to LFs.

(These body chunks can be buffered by the milter for later replacement
via SMFIR_REPLBODY during the SMFIC_BODYEOB phase.)

**

'C'	SMFIC_CONNECT	SMTP connection information
			Expected response:  Accept/reject action

char	hostname[]	Hostname, NUL terminated
char	family		Protocol family (see below)
uint16	port		Port number (SMFIA_INET or SMFIA_INET6 only)
char	address[]	IP address (ASCII) or unix socket path, NUL terminated

(Sendmail invoked via the command line or via "-bs" will report the
connection as the "Unknown" protocol family.)

Protocol families used with SMFIC_CONNECT in the "family" field:

'U'	SMFIA_UNKNOWN	Unknown (NOTE: Omits "port" and "host" fields entirely)
'L'	SMFIA_UNIX	Unix (AF_UNIX/AF_LOCAL) socket ("port" is 0)
'4'	SMFIA_INET	TCPv4 connection
'6'	SMFIA_INET6	TCPv6 connection

**

'D'	SMFIC_MACRO	Define macros
			Expected response:  NONE

char	cmdcode		Command for which these macros apply
char	nameval[][]	Array of NUL-terminated strings, alternating
			between name of macro and value of macro.

SMFIC_MACRO appears as a packet just before the corresponding "cmdcode"
(here), which is the same identifier as the following command.  The
names correspond to Sendmail macros, omitting the "$" identifier
character.

Types of macros, and some commonly supplied macro names, used with
SMFIC_MACRO are as follows, organized by "cmdcode" value.  
Implementations SHOULD NOT assume that any of these macros will be
present on a given connection.  In particular, communications protocol
information may not be present on the "Unknown" protocol type.

'C'	SMFIC_CONNECT	$_ $j ${daemon_name} ${if_name} ${if_addr}

'H'	SMFIC_HELO	${tls_version} ${cipher} ${cipher_bits}
			${cert_subject} ${cert_issuer}

'M'	SMFIC_MAIL	$i ${auth_type} ${auth_authen} ${auth_ssf}
			${auth_author} ${mail_mailer} ${mail_host}
			${mail_addr}

'R'	SMFIC_RCPT	${rcpt_mailer} ${rcpt_host} ${rcpt_addr}

For future compatibility, implementations MUST allow SMFIC_MACRO at any
time, but the handling of unspecified command codes, or SMFIC_MACRO not
appearing before its specified command, is currently undefined.

**

'E'	SMFIC_BODYEOB	End of body marker
			Expected response:  Zero or more modification
			actions, then accept/reject action

**

'H'	SMFIC_HELO	HELO/EHLO name
			Expected response:  Accept/reject action

char	helo[]		HELO string, NUL terminated

**

'L'	SMFIC_HEADER	Mail header
			Expected response:  Accept/reject action

char	name[]		Name of header, NUL terminated
char	value[]		Value of header, NUL terminated

**

'M'	SMFIC_MAIL	MAIL FROM: information
			Expected response:  Accept/reject action

char	args[][]	Array of strings, NUL terminated (address at index 0).
			args[0] is sender, with <> qualification.
			args[1] and beyond are ESMTP arguments, if any.

**

'N'	SMFIC_EOH	End of headers marker
			Expected response:  Accept/reject action

**

'O'	SMFIC_OPTNEG	Option negotiation
			Expected response:  SMFIC_OPTNEG packet

uint32	version		SMFI_VERSION (2)
uint32	actions		Bitmask of allowed actions from SMFIF_*
uint32	protocol	Bitmask of possible protocol content from SMFIP_*

**

'R'	SMFIC_RCPT	RCPT TO: information
			Expected response:  Accept/reject action

char	args[][]	Array of strings, NUL terminated (address at index 0).
			args[0] is recipient, with <> qualification.
			args[1] and beyond are ESMTP arguments, if any.

**

'Q'	SMFIC_QUIT	Quit milter communication
			Expected response:  Close milter connection

______________
RESPONSE CODES

The following are commands transmitted from the milter program to the
MTA, in response to the appropriate type of command packet.  The data
structures represented occupy the "cmd" and "data" fields of the packets
described above in LINK/PACKET PROTOCOL.  (In other words, the data
structures below take up exactly "len" bytes, including the "cmd" byte.)

**

Response codes:

'+'	SMFIR_ADDRCPT	Add recipient (modification action)

char	rcpt[]		New recipient, NUL terminated

**

'-'	SMFIR_DELRCPT	Remove recipient (modification action)

char	rcpt[]		Recipient to remove, NUL terminated
			(string must match the one in SMFIC_RCPT exactly)

**

'a'	SMFIR_ACCEPT	Accept message completely (accept/reject action)

(This will skip to the end of the milter sequence, and recycle back to
the state before SMFIC_MAIL.  The MTA may, instead, close the connection
at that point.)

**

'b'	SMFIR_REPLBODY	Replace body (modification action)

char	buf[]		A portion of the body to be replaced

The buffer is not NUL-terminated.

As with SMFIC_BODY, the body SHOULD be encoded with CRLF line endings.
Sendmail will convert CRLFs to bare LFs as it receives SMFIR_REPLBODY
responses (even if the CR and LF are split across two responses); the
behavior of other MTAs has not been investigated.

A milter that uses SMFIR_REPLBODY must replace the entire body, but
it may split the new replacement body across multiple SMFIR_REPLBODY
responses and it may make each response as small as it wants (and
they do not need to correspond one to one with SMFIC_BODY messages).
There is no explicit end of body marker; this role is filled by
whatever accept/reject response the milter finishes with.

**

'c'	SMFIR_CONTINUE	Accept and keep processing (accept/reject action)

(If issued at the end of the milter conversation, functions the same as
SMFIR_ACCEPT.)

**

'd'	SMFIR_DISCARD	Set discard flag for entire message (accept/reject action)

(Note that message processing MAY continue afterwards, but the mail will
not be delivered even if accepted with SMFIR_ACCEPT.)

**

'h'	SMFIR_ADDHEADER	Add header (modification action)

char	name[]		Name of header, NUL terminated
char	value[]		Value of header, NUL terminated

**

'm'	SMFIR_CHGHEADER	Change header (modification action)

uint32	index		Index of the occurrence of this header
char	name[]		Name of header, NUL terminated
char	value[]		Value of header, NUL terminated

(Note that the "index" above is per-name--i.e. a 3 in this field
indicates that the modification is to be applied to the third such
header matching the supplied "name" field.  A zero length string for
"value", leaving only a single NUL byte, indicates that the header
should be deleted entirely.)

**

'p'	SMFIR_PROGRESS	Progress (asynchronous action)

This is an asynchronous response which is sent to the MTA to reset the
communications timer during long operations.  The MTA should consume
as many of these responses as are sent, waiting for the real response
for the issued command.

**

'q'	SMFIR_QUARANTINE Quarantine message (modification action)
char	reason[]	Reason for quarantine, NUL terminated

This quarantines the message into a holding pool defined by the MTA. 
(First implemented in Sendmail in version 8.13; offered to the milter by 
the SMFIF_QUARANTINE flag in "actions" of SMFIC_OPTNEG.)

**

'r'	SMFIR_REJECT	Reject command/recipient with a 5xx (accept/reject action)

**

't'	SMFIR_TEMPFAIL	Reject command/recipient with a 4xx (accept/reject action)

**

'y'	SMFIR_REPLYCODE	Send specific Nxx reply message (accept/reject action)

char	smtpcode[3]	Nxx code (ASCII), not NUL terminated
char	space		' '
char	text[]		Text of reply message, NUL terminated

('%' characters present in "text" must be doubled to prevent problems
with printf-style formatting that may be used by the MTA.)

**

'O'	SMFIC_OPTNEG	Option negotiation (in response to SMFIC_OPTNEG)

uint32	version		SMFI_VERSION (2)
uint32	actions		Bitmask of requested actions from SMFIF_*
uint32	protocol	Bitmask of undesired protocol content from SMFIP_*
